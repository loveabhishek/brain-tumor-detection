# Brain Tumor Detection

## Project Overview
This project is a **Brain Tumor Detection system** that uses machine learning to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It helps doctors and medical professionals identify tumors quickly and accurately.

---

## Features
- Detects brain tumors from MRI scans.
- Classifies tumors into different types (if applicable).
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- Provides accuracy metrics for model performance.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Frontend (if any):** Streamlit / Flask / React
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub

---

## Installation & Setup

. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Run the project:

~ If it’s a notebook: Open brain_tumor_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
# If its a web app:
# streamlit run app.py  # (if using Streamlit)
# or
python app.py          # (if using Flask)
## Usage

Upload an MRI image of the brain.

Click Predict to see if a tumor is detected.

The system will display the result along with the probability score (if implemented).

## Model Performance

Accuracy: XX% (replace with your model’s accuracy)

Loss: XX%

Confusion Matrix and other evaluation metrics (if available)
